While using the osTicket system, I was able to set up roles, departments and teams as an administrator. After, I created agents. Each agent was a given access to a department and a corresponding role. Agents were then created in the agent panel.

Going back to administrator panel, I created 3 different SLAs (service level agreements). This will help with organization as it provides a lenght in time in which each ticket is expected to be closed by the help Desk Administrator.

Lastly, I created 4 more help desk topics for the users to specify what area of assistance is needed for the ticket they're working on.
